# VoxelEngine

**This project is no longer maintained**

<br>

## Demo video

The demo video can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T4hT0OZSl4).

<br>

## What is this?

The goal of this project was to develop my own voxel engine using OpenGL and C++. 

<br>

## What it does?

The engine (procedurally) randomly generates the world like the Minecraft or Cube World. 

That said, features such as biomes and sandboxing are implementd where user can play around.

Though the playability is quite limited as the project ended during the prototyping.

<br>

## So what's next?

I'm still intrested in creating game using procedural random generation,

where the everything (world, quest, items, npc, etc) is randomly generated;

but somewhat controlled to avoid "too much random".
